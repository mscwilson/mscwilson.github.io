## Portfolio
A basic Jekyll site that might end up showcasing my projects - or just being a playground to test things out.

### Description
I'm using Jekyll, a static site generator, for my blog and simple homepage. I set it up using the Minimal Mistakes premade theme, which has been great but is overkill for my needs. It contained a lot of things I'm not using (e.g. Comments capability), and I found the project structure confusing since I'd never used SASS before.  

Therefore I decided to start a new Jekyll page from scratch, with just the features I need: about me; a portfolio and my projects; my blog; and the ability to change between light and dark theme, because I think that's really fun.    

This is a work in progress.

### Usage
* Clone this repo and navigate into the folder
* Run `bundle` to install dependencies
* Check out the site locally: `jekyll serve`
