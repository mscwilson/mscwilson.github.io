## Miranda Making Things

My personal site, using the Jekyll framework with [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. Hosted [here](https://mscwilson.github.io) on GitHub Pages.

It's named "Miranda Making Things" because my name is Miranda, and I like making things.

### Description

This site gives information about me, and is mainly a platform for my [blog](https://github.com/mscwilson/blog). When I set it up I didn't know anything about web development, but was excited to learn. For that reason I chose to blog on my own page with Jekyll rather than using e.g. Medium.  

The Minimal Mistakes theme provides all the necessary configuration, styling and structure to easily add content. Since completing the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp I have more website knowledge, and have started to customise the code. It's important to me that I don't lose the responsive design, and that I maintain an integrated look with my [blog](https://mscwilson.github.io/blog), which is actually hosted separately.

It currently looks like this:  ![homepage](/homepage/assets/images/screenshot_readme.png)

My goal is to create a complete homepage with information about me, the link to my blog, and a portfolio page to highlight things I've made, while keeping a consistent style.
