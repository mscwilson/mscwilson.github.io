## Portfolio
A basic Jekyll site that might end up showcasing my projects - or just being a playground to test things out.

### Description
I'm using Jekyll, a static site generator, for my blog and simple homepage. I set it up using the Minimal Mistakes premade theme, which has been great but is overkill for my needs.  

Therefore I decided to start a new Jekyll page from scratch, with just the features I need: about me; a portfolio and my projects; my blog; and a button to change the theme between light and dark, because I think that's really fun.  

I followed [this](https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/) tutorial to set up the Jekyll project structure and config, with Bootstrap to provide a navigation bar. I imported [this](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/dark-mode-toggle) brilliant dark-mode-toggle HTML element for the theme switching.   

This is a work in progress.

### Usage
* Clone this repo and navigate into the folder
* Run `bundle` to install dependencies
* Check out the site locally: `jekyll serve`
