## My Site

My personal site, using the Jekyll framework with [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. Hosted [here](https://mscwilson.github.io) on GitHub Pages.

### Description
I initially set up this site for my [blog](https://mscwilson.github.io/blog). Then I realised that I wanted my blog to have the URL `/blog`, so I migrated it to a separate GitHub [repo](https://github.com/mscwilson/blog), by duplicating this repo, and then removing the blog posts and displays from this site.  

It currently looks like this:  ![homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10324709/115954683-2bdae380-a4ea-11eb-8f50-e47fffeda59d.png)

My goal is to create a nice homepage with an about me, a portfolio, and a link to my blog, while keeping the Minimal Mistakes style so that the blog still looks and feels integrated.
