The internet was down (again!!) today. Virgin Media has been struggling since the summer or even as soon as the lockdown started last year. It stopped working at 9.45am; they said it would be fixed by 2pm. Then it would be fixed by 8pm. Now it will be fixed by 10am tomorrow. It's been a stressful day. I am stressed.

I can get some internet - about 0.4 Mbps - by tethering off my phone. It turns out that's not really enough for video calls. It's barely enough even to download gems in a useful timeframe. So I had to give up on pair programming this afternoon - my partner Joe was very patient but it just didn't work. I feel guilty that he didn't get to make much progress on this week's challenge today - especially as I had started today several steps behind him, so he was revisiting yesterday's work. Argh. I missed the day.

I don't mind being behind, but I do mind not knowing where I should be up to (hahah so maybe I do mind being behind after all). I checked some github repos but I don't know how long the steps would take to catch up. I don't want to hold up my partner tomorrow as well. Not that it would actually be a problem - it's brand new complicated stuff that I'm sure they would be happy to go over again. I'm mainly feeling panicked that the internet will still be broken tomorrow and I still won't be able to do anything.

It's now nearly 11pm. I have managed to install the right gems and write a feature test. My first experience with Capybara!
