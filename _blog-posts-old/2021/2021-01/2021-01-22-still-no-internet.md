Still no wifi. Three days now it's been down and I haven't been able to join in with workshops or pair programming (or stream music, watch videos, download software...). I have a new appreciation for pair programming (which I was enjoying a lot anyway). This is really boring!

I have probably made quicker progress through the tasks/challenges than if I'd been working with others. In pairs there is time spent reading stuff out, discussing interpretations and ideas for problem solving, and chatting of course. But that way is more fun and could well have more opportunities for finding out something useful/interesting.

I have learned how to make a basic website using Sinatra. But not yet how to host it online so I can show off to friends and family. I also learned:
* how to save all files in Sublime
* about `srand`, to seed `rand` to always get the same answer
* how to make Dark mode switch on at a sensible time - by installing [NightOwl](https://nightowl.kramser.xyz/)
* that I don't know anything about design patterns
