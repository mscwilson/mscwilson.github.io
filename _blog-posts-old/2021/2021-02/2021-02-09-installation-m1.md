It's taken me two weeks but I have finally got all the software installed and my projects working on my new computer. It's a Mac Mini with the new M1 chip. I hadn't considered quite how new the M1 chip is. An accidental early adopter - I was starting to think I should give up and get a refund.

Shoutout to [this helpful person](https://github.com/kivikakk) on Github whose comment [here](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker/issues/128) helped me get Jekyll working again. It turned out that I had - again! - set up my Jekyll wrong. At least I didn't have to set it up from scratch again this time. I was supposed to have set gems to install into the vendor folder (`config set --local path "vendor/bundle"`) and I hadn't. As to how I fixed my Sinatra repos using `bcrypt` and `eventmachine`, I have no idea. Just kept running `bundle` or `gem install` in various ways until it worked maybe?! I thought I had cracked it when I realised that the terminal running inside Sublime Text (Terminus plugin) wasn't the same as the ones in iTerm. But in retrospect I don't know if that was the difference or not. Oh well it works!

Edit: (the next morning) I realised what was going on with Terminal. The Mac M1 chip isn't supported by much software yet. When I saw error messages like this
```
LoadError (dlopen(/Users/mirandawilson/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.2/gems/bcrypt-3.1.16/lib/bcrypt_ext.bundle, 9): no suitable image found.  Did find:)
/Users/mirandawilson/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.2/gems/bcrypt-3.1.16/lib/bcrypt_ext.bundle: mach-o, but wrong architecture‚Äù
```
I thought maybe it mentioned architecture was because the gem wasn't installed natively (arm64) but with the old Intel x86_64 type of instructions, enabled by Apple's Rosetta bridging software. Somehow this led to me running `arch` in the terminal. I was using the Terminus plugin inside Sublime as usual, since I was messing around with Gemfiles etc. `arch` said "i386". What's that? It's an Intel chip thing. Asking `arch` or the related `machine`, `uname -p` and `uname -m` in the iTerm terminal gave only answers about ARM.

At the time I thought maybe this is why my gems weren't working, because I had been installing through the "i386" terminal/architecture. Note that I have no actual idea what architecture means. I moved over to the proper iTerm terminal where I did get everything installed. Although it gave the "but wrong architecture" error a few more times there as well, so who knows. Anyway, I suddenly remembered that Sublime Text isn't natively supported yet. It's using Rosetta. Meaning it is using x86_64! Hence the terminal running in there is understandably also in x86_64. As long as I remember to only install things using the real terminal I think it'll be alright.


Now I can finally move on to more interesting setup things like making Sublime look nice.

Spotify recommended this track for me yesterday. Kind of bluesy alternative rock, reminds me of Nick Cave (or what I think Nick Cave sounds like, probably not accurate). It's nice:
