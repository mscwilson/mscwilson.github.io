I started my Makers final project this week! On Monday morning we were given our team assignments, then spent the rest of the day planning what to do and how to do it. Our plan is to make a mobile app, where the user enters how far they will be driving, and the app says how bad it is in terms of carbon footprint.  

As a team, we are generally more interested in backend than frontend. But somehow we ended up deciding on a project which is entirely frontend?! It's going well so far - after a false start. We all wanted an excuse to learn Python, but we also all wanted to make a mobile app. There's a library called [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) for making cross-platform Python apps, which seemed like it should be perfect. There were several problems:
* bad official documentation
* bad/non-existent unofficial documentation/walkthroughs
* difficult to install
* doesn't support Python 3 for iOS apps!

Python 2 stopped being supported a year ago ðŸ˜’. So, Kivy was out, and Python was out.  

We ended up deciding on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). I'm very happy with that decision so far. The documentation is fantastic, the internet is full of walkthroughs and tutorials, there are loads of libraries to use with it, and it seems reasonably straight-forward to use, even though we've never tried React. It's made of JavaScript. Good to have another crack at liking JavaScript.

We set up a new project using [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/). It's a framework for making cross-platform apps simply; Expo hides a lot of the config files and deals with the building. With the best of intentions, we tried to TDD. It turns out there is no end-to-end test library that works with a Managed Expo project!

I love Sublime Text but this seemed like a good opportunity to try out VSCode for a couple of weeks. It's very flashy and polished compared to Sublime. For example, in Sublime the keybindings settings are a JSON file. In VSCode it's a proper UI thing with widgets, a search box, you can select the new key combo by actually pressing it on the keyboard, can reset etc. User-friendly I suppose? Though, it's for developers. JSON files are fine. More importantly, I tried to change the keybinding for showing a Terminal and it didn't work, I had to change it back.

Still, because it's the most fashionable text editor, there are amazing plugins. I was nearly tempted over before by the Live Server plugin when we were doing websites. I have colourful brackets, colourful indentations, a working JavaScript linter, a debugger, and my theme automatically switches between light and dark. And a lot of Git integration that I haven't got round to setting up in Sublime. So I am grudgingly enjoying VSCode.

I wrote the title of this post and immediately thought of this Smashing Pumpkins song. How young they look in this video! I was lucky enough to finally see them live at a festival - I was going to say last year - two years ago. Sadly, Billy Corgan was really struggling with his voice.
