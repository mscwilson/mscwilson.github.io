I have graduated from Makers! Friday was the last day of the course. Now I'm in the hands of the careers team, as a Job Hunter. I didn't realise there would be so much support, so I'm really pleased.  

We all presented our final projects at a public open day. My role in our presentation was to talk about challenges we'd faced (within 1 min). I explained about the impossibility of making mobile apps in Python, the limitations of an Expo managed workflow, and the challenge of getting data from storage asynchronously. Describing things for a lay audience always feels awkward to me: I like to be accurate! But the correct words can't be used because they're jargon, and glossing over complexity is required. Like in school biology when they taught photosynthesis or respiration as one simple equation each. Writing lay abstracts throughout my scientific career normally ended up saying we were going to cure cancer.  

I still miss (aspects of) science.  
Things I miss:
* Looking at cells
* Finding out things no-one ever knew
* The dark room and the X-Ray film developer
* Being an expert
* Knowledge as the focus, not money
* Setting my own agenda
* The day-to-day lab activities of pipetting, measuring, mixing
* Being good at the above

Things I do not miss:
* Failed experiments
* Experiments that worked before but don't any more!! ðŸ˜ž
* Negative results
* Microscopy
* Copy editing for the lab
* Ordering supplies for the lab
* Being too busy to progress my own project
* Long hours working with cells
* Weekend working
* No chance of career progression  
  
I don't know what being a professional developer will be like. But I think I can guarantee it won't involve, for example, making sure there are enough pens available, or defrosting the freezers. And code can be written and run at any time - no need to wait 6 or 24 hours between each small activity. My main motivation in academia? Probably a high % of my love of postdoc life was down to enjoyment of a job well done, rather than contributing to the sum of human knowledge. I was good at lab work. Luckily, now I have the opportunity to become good at coding and enjoy that instead.

The afternoon temperature in London today and yesterday was 22ÂºC! A heat wave. It'll be 8ÂºC again next week. I spent some time in the garden: first weeding and watering of the year; first hula hoop session of the year; first wearing of sunglasses this year. It felt like summer. Which of course reminded me of this track, Feels Like Summer by Weezer. Essential listening for all hot weather. I played this track so much last year (and the previous years).
