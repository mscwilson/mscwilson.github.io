  <h3 style="text-align: center;">About me</h3>
  I recently graduated from the <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers</a> coding bootcamp, after 12 years as a cell biologist. I learned an incredible amount! Now I'm looking forward to getting my first job in tech. Check out my CV <a href="https://github.com/mscwilson/curriculum-vitae">here</a>.<br /><br />


  Please go to my <a href="http://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/">blog</a> to read a wide-eyed account
  of my journey to becoming a developer, as well as tutorials for things like setting up <a href="https://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/2021/01/27/online-webapp/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/2021/02/01/walkthrough-chitter-orm/">ActiveRecord with Sinatra</a>.

  Here's me and my dog during a very wet camping trip last October (later that day our tent collapsed and filled with rain):<br />

  <h3 style="text-align: center;">About this site</h3>
  This page is created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> theme, which provides all the necessary structure, configuration, and styling. This was perfect for me at the start of 2021, before I knew anything about web development. It was initially a platform for my blog, which I started so I could share my excitement at all the new things I was discovering during my bootcamp. <br /><br />Jekyll is a static site generator and is designed with blogging in mind, as all that's needed to write a new post is to create a new Markdown file. It seemed like it would be more fun and educational to 
  make my own site than posting on Medium or WordPress. This site is hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, a free GitHub-based hosting service based on Jekyll.<br /><br />

  I'm slowly working on personalising the code. My next goal is to add a portfolio page to share all the cool stuff I've made. In the meantime, check out my <a href="https://github.com/mscwilson">GitHub</a>. <br /><br />
