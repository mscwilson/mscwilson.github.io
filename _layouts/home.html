    <h4 class="text-primary">About Me</h4>
    <div class="py-3 px-4">
      <p>I love making things. Specifically useful things, but I'm not fussy about materials. Wood, fabric, plastic, code - it's all good. I like a challenge.</p>
      <p>As a cell biologist, I made solutions, pieces of DNA, and genetically modified cells. Cells are the framework for the original coding languages! DNA, RNA and protein. I left science to learn new things. I realised that my favourite part of the job was the technical problem-solving. Coding has: fun problems, lots to learn, making useful stuff.</p>
      <p>Now I'm working with computer languages. I recently graduated from the <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers</a> bootcamp and am looking for my first full stack or backend role. <span class="text-secondary bg-primary">You can hire me!</span> Check out my CV <a href="https://github.com/mscwilson/curriculum-vitae">here.</a> I live in London, UK.</p>

      <p>Check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> for my wide-eyed account of becoming a developer. It's where I get to share all the exciting things I'm making and learning, as well as tutorials for things like setting up <a href="https://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/2021/01/27/online-webapp/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://www.mirandawilson.tech/blog/2021/02/01/walkthrough-chitter-orm/">ActiveRecord</a> with Sinatra. Also you get some music recommendations. Occasionally pictures of my dog.</p> 

      <p>Speaking of which, here's me and my dog during a very wet camping trip in October 2020 (later that day our tent collapsed and filled with rain):<br />
