    <div class="py-3 px-4">
      <p>I love making things. Specifically useful things, but I'm not fussy about materials. Wood, fabric, plastic,
        code - it's all good. I like a challenge.</p>
      <p>As a cell biologist, I made solutions, pieces of DNA, and genetically modified cells. Cells are the framework
        for the original coding languages! <span class="language text-secondary">DNA</span>, <span
          class="language text-secondary">RNA</span> and <span class="language text-secondary">protein</span>.</p>
      <p>I left science to learn new things. I realised that my favourite part of the job was the technical
        problem-solving. My new career, coding, is about making useful stuff with fun problems and lots to learn.</p>
      <p>Now I'm working with computer languages. I'm a graduate engineer at <a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">
          Snowplow Analytics</a>. I live in London, UK.</p>

      <h6>My Languages & Frameworks/Libraries</h6>

      </ul>
      <p>Check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> for my wide-eyed account of becoming a developer. It's where I get to
        share all the exciting things I'm making and learning, as well as tutorials for things like setting up <a
          href="{% post_url 2021-01-27-online-webapp %}">Heroku</a> or <a
          href="{% post_url 2021-02-01-walkthrough-chitter-orm %}">ActiveRecord</a> with Sinatra. Also you get some
        music recommendations. Occasionally pictures of my dog.</p>

      <p>Speaking of which, here's me and my dog during a very wet camping trip in October 2020 (later that day our tent
        collapsed and filled with rain):<br />
