This blog is, and my coding skills themselves are, very much under development. I'm considering putting one of those 90s gifs here saying so.

I am a new developer based in London. I started out teaching myself python, now I'm completing the Makers Academy full-stack development bootcamp. I want to use this blog to chart my progress in becoming a junior dev, and write about any interesting/fun/cool things I come across.

I chose to use Jekyll rather than Wordpress or Medium for this blog to make it difficult for myself. I'm having to learn Markdown just to post! 

I know basic Python and slightly less basic Ruby.

### More Information

I used to be a cell biologist working in academic basic research. I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for opportunities to code things relating to biology/biotech.
