        <p>Visit to Ebberns Bathroom Showroom!</p>

        <h5>Mirror</h5>
        <p>I really liked this mirror. Probably (based on poster) it's Aeon Solas 60. I like that the mirror is pretty big, but also has this cool lit-up circle. Also it can change colour warm->cool light. </p>

        <p>This one is also nice. I liked the shelf underneath.  No idea about light options. Except that here the light is behind the mirror so less good for actual illumination.</p>

        <h5>Sink</h5>
        <p>This was my favourite sink. It doesn't stick out much into the room, but is a reasonable size overall because rectangular. The flat bit to one side is unusual. I like the black tap and plug hole thing they've used.</p>
        <p>However, I don't like the cabinet with it. I definitely want one which doesn't touch the floor, so probably 1-2 drawers rather than a cupboard. The cabinet should be black probably.</p>

        <p>This one is bigger and takes up too much space. But I like the black worktop that the sink is set into, and the floating drawers. </p>

        <h5>Radiator</h5>
        <p>Nothing stood out for radiators. This one is matte black, the correct colour, but I'm not sure on the shape. It's alright. I possibly prefer the shape of this silver one as the lines are cleaner. Except the silver has fewer pipes so probably it doesn't work as well. The one we saw at Porcelanosa was more attractive, iirc it was blockier/more square looking.</p>
        <p>I don't know if they have the option for electric element.</p>

        <h5>Taps and shower</h5>
        <p>This set with handheld plus controls looked neat. Except if this was on the side of the bath, the cable would hang down annoyingly into the bath.</p>

        <p>Comedy tap.</p>

        <img style="max-width: 40%; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bathroom_images/eb_funny_tap.JPG"><br/>

        <p>Straight-forward set of shower parts and tap. I don't massively love the tap. The spout part is small, looks too delicate.</p>

        <p>I like the knurling on this one.</p>

        <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
        <p>This shower screen has gold detailing. Is it possible to get one with black? Another attractive round mirror in this pic.</p>

        <p>I liked these toilet controls. No text, not too rounded, very clean look.</p>

        <img style="max-width: 40%; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bathroom_images/eb_black_toilet_buttons.JPG"><br/>

        <p>Interesting idea for adding storage. I like the look though not sure if there is a place for them in the design.</p>

        <p>Matte black drawer handle. Nothing fancy. Btw, I just remembered that I will want a hook/couple of hooks on the wall for hanging dressing gown etc. Should be basic matte black thing as well.</p>

        <h5>Tiles</h5>
        <p>These were the only tiles I liked there. Very expensive. "Janus Glass Brick 22x7.6cm £4.74 each/ £283.49 psm". I'm looking forward to visiting the tile showroom/warehouse. </p>
