Good things today:
- set up an alias/function in zsh to do git add . commit and push all in one go. Based on [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23328996). I even understand what it's saying
- learned more about the reasoning behind TDD, wrote a lot more tests and started to feel more comfortable with rspec
- enjoyable pairing session in the afternoon. My pair was at a similar level to me technically so we made great progress, and he could quickly explain things to me that I hadn't got yet

Bad things today:
- Why isn't the Sublime plugin SublimeLinter working?
- Why isn't the Sublime plugin Pretty Ruby working?
- Why isn't the Sublime plugin Terminus changing the colour theme when I tell it to?

Edit: on the last point, it turned out that I just had to quit Sublime after changing the settings, unlike the other theme plugins I've looked at. Still, it wasn't easy to find a nice light theme and there wasn't proper documentation. So I decided to set my own colours instead using the user theme. Turned out to be quite difficult as I didn't know what the list of numbers and colours referred to. Anyway I used trial and error to find out which things came out which colour.
Here's what I came up with for my first try.
