The alliteration doesn't work but Feamwork is almost ok. Today we finished our team projects! [Ours was great](https://github.com/JoshSinyor/makersbnb), I'm proud of it. Actually we got loads of functionality in, because we saved a lot of time not having to write basic model code (using ActiveRecord <3). And now it's Friday! It must be relaxing o'clock. It's certainly takeaway-o'clock.

I saw this video a while ago and now I think of it most Fridays:

Yeah!

Our team was really good. We had a nice time, loads of communication, very productive, good division of labour... I did occasionally forget that messing around and getting distracted from The Current Plan was the actual Plan, but not too badly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, TDD/BDD got forgotten somewhat as the deadline loomed. Maybe just by me. Generally we did have feature tests but I wrote quite a few lines for date validation this morning without any tests at all (in my head I was "just refactoring"). Maybe not needing to write unit tests went to my head! In fact we should have needed unit tests, for model methods, because there is loads of logic all over the controller and views.

Today I learned that you can make a nice little mini calendar in an HTML form just by saying `<input type="date">`. Looks fun to play with.

This track just came up on my Spotify Release Radar. Really nice. And suitably Friday-y. Certainly more Friday-y that the experimental/avant-garde metal track that followed it. It's some kind of electronica I suppose:
