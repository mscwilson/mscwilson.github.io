It's taken me two weeks but I have finally got all the software installed and my projects working on my new computer. It's a Mac Mini with the new M1 chip. I hadn't considered quite how new the M1 chip is. An accidental early adopter - I was starting to think I should give up and get a refund.

Shoutout to [this helpful person](https://github.com/kivikakk) on Github whose comment [here](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker/issues/128) helped me get Jekyll working again. It turned out that I had - again! - set up my Jekyll wrong. At least I didn't have to set it up from scratch again this time. I was supposed to have set gems to install into the vendor folder (`config set --local path "vendor/bundle"`) and I hadn't. As to how I fixed my Sinatra repos using `bcrypt` and `eventmachine`, I have no idea. Just kept running `bundle` or `gem install` in various ways until it worked maybe?! I thought I had cracked it when I realised that the terminal running inside Sublime Text (Terminus plugin) wasn't the same as the ones in iTerm. But in retrospect I don't know if that was the difference or not. Oh well it works!

Now I can finally move on to more interesting setup things like making Sublime look nice.


Spotify recommended this track for me yesterday. Kind of bluesy alternative rock, reminds me of Nick Cave (or what i think Nick Cave sounds like, probably not accurate). It's nice:
