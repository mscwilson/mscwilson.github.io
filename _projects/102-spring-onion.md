Spring Onion is a mobile app on iOS and Android that allow users to calculate the carbon footprint of car journeys.

All the user needs is their (UK) licence plate and the distance travelled, and the app returns the amount of CO2 emitted. This is put into context, by providing an example of another activity that produces the same amount of CO2. To mitigate the effects of their journey, the user can buy carbon offsets by clicking through to a website for this.
This was a team project in the final two weeks of <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers</a> coding bootcamp.
