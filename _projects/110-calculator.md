This was my first ever coding project, after teaching myself basic Python 2.7. I'm still very proud of it, so I'm including it here despite the code being hilariously bad (and depreciated). It actually does still run, for now. It's a GUI calculator app with the standard operations, as well as ANS and EXP buttons.
