I decided to look into why this blog looked so terrible and not how I expected. It turned out to be because I had started it with one theme ([Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) and then tried to migrate to another ([Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)). But clearly I hadn't set it up right. I just started again with a fresh Minimal Mistakes repo and it looks pretty good. Or at least much better!
