I called my site Miranda Making Things, because I like making things. Other kinds of technology are great too, so I'll post projects even if they're not made of code.  

Here's an extremely simple but hopefully effective project I finished this week: a dog barrier. Specifically, a barrier to stop my dog getting into our raised flowerbed, where she could a) hurt herself jumping, and b) eat all my tomatoes again this year.

I bought some 2.4 m long wooden battens and sawed them into the right lengths. I chose cheap rough-cut wood since it's just for the garden. I drilled holes through the battens and screwed them directly into the decking railing balusters, alternating where the screws went to reduce the chance of the baluster wood splitting. For the spacing, I put a leftover bit of the wood in between them to make the top piece parallel.  

Any day where I get to use my lovely drill is a good day. My next DIY project involves buying a handheld jigsaw, I am very excited about it.

That's now a 50 cm drop, and she is only 30 cm tall. I don't think she'll try it. Admittedly, I also thought she'd baulk when just the lower wood strips were in place, but then I caught her calmly exploring the bed. I had to go back to the shop to get more wood for the top bars.
