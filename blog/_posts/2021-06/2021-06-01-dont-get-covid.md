My advice: don't get covid! It's rubbish.  

Luckily I had a mild case, but still spent most of last week tired, sore and achey, and unable to do any difficult thinking. I tried to read up on APIs in Rails but my brain started panicking and I had to rest instead. I was thinking, "I don't get it... how did I make a website? I can't concentrate on anything". Then I remembered that I didn't have covid the previous week.  

Today I've slept enough and am ready to work! Going straight in with learning how to use Docker. Me right now:

To be fair Docker have made a tutorial to follow, based around a todo (always makes me think of dodos) app. It's pretty cool.  

I discovered that VSCode is not using Rosetta like I thought it was - the Terminal in there is using the actual silicon architecture! [Very alarming]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-03-01-system_reset %}), I don't want things to get installed wrong again! At least more software supports M1 chips now. I found this [helpful article](https://earthly.dev/blog/using-apple-silicon-m1-as-a-cloud-engineer-two-months-in/) about how to use Docker on silicon, by specifying `--platform=linux/amd64`.

I didn't listen to any music last week because it was too tiring. Now I'm enjoying these summery vibes from Acid Pauli. It's 25Â°C today! Including in my office unfortunately.
