I'm very happy with my first week. Everyone in my cohort seems nice and it's been fun getting to know them so far. I also learned some rspec.

Today I got stuck on some basic Ruby, about arbitrary arguments (*args). I was making a dice roller. There was a method that took an arbitrary number of dice, then another method that rolled them and got the results. My problem was that I couldn't think of how to print out the results in nice English based on how many there were.

I wanted it to look like this:
```ruby
score = [1]
puts "You rolled a #{score}!"

score = [2, 5]
puts "You rolled #{score[0]} and #{score[1]}. That's #{score.sum} in total!"

score = [4, 1, 6, 1, 1]
puts "You rolled 4, 1, 6, 1 and 1. That's #{score.sum} in total!"
```
I had no ideas at all, completely blocked. I went to see if my husband knew anything about *args and explained what I wanted from my code. As soon as he said "join" I realised it was actually an extremely easy problem.

```ruby
if score.length == 1
  puts "You rolled a #{score}!"
else
  puts "You rolled #{score[0..-2].join(", ")} and #{score[-1]}. That's #{score.sum} in total!"
end
```
Maybe I could put it as a ternary thing since there are only two conditions (length 0 isn't possible):
```ruby
puts score.length == 1 ? "You rolled a #{score}!" : "You rolled #{score[0..-2].join(", ")} and #{score[-1]}. That's #{score.sum} in total!"
```
I like Ruby.
