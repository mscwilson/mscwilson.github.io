### What needs doing
For the portfolio section:
* Fix the padding on Portfolio page, add a short blurb
* ~~Add projects - as Bootstrap cards maybe. Links to github and live project if possible.~~
* Fix cards layout in responsive grid
* Make individual project pages? Or modals maybe?
<br/><br/>
  
* DRY out the CSS?!
* Fix domain pointing, GitHub says there's a problem
* Set up CI?
* Make a better 404 page
* Show image thumbnails that can be expanded out
* Fix the redirects for first 20 posts
* Different colour for link that's been visited
* Fancy JS underline for navbar link hover like in Minimal Mistakes?
* Make the banner look better - narrower, different images - ideally same image but different overlay or something
* Add share buttons (twitter, fb, linkedin)
* Add a scrolling about section on the left like on old site?
* Consider using background images or gradients so it looks less flat
* Add a nice table of tag frequencies for tags page
* Make youtube embeds centred (and full width on mobile)
* Make posts archive perfectly aligned
